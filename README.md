# Avenue-Segment-Assessment-on-Roads
# Project Description
Roads degrade over time due to usage, environmental conditions, and structural failures. Continuous evaluation ensures safe mobility and reduces accident risks. Avenue Segment Assessment focuses on analyzing smaller sections of a roadway to identify varying levels of deterioration. This project creates a structured method to inspect, classify, and visualize the health of road segments.

# Problem Statement 
Traditional road inspection methods rely heavily on manual observations, which are:
Time-consuming and labor-intensive
Prone to human error
Inconsistent across different inspectors
Conducted infrequently, missing early signs of damage

# Objectives
To assess road segments using physical, structural, and environmental parameters
To classify road condition using a standard index (RCI/PCR)
To automate data collection through sensors, smartphone apps, or drones
To implement GIS-based mapping and visual representation
To help authorities prioritize road repair schedules
To reduce accident risks and improve transportation quality
To support smart city maintenance frameworks

# System Requirements
Hardware Requirements:
Smartphone with GPS (for mobile-data collection)
IoT Sensors (optional):Accelerometer
Gyroscope
Vibration sensors
LIDAR or ultrasonic (for defect measurement)
Computer/Laptop for processing
Drone with camera (optional for aerial assessment)
B) Software Requirements
Operating System: Windows / Linux / Android
Tools:
Python
OpenCV (if using image analysis)
GIS tools (QGIS/ArcGIS)
Excel/SQL database
Web dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS)
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
